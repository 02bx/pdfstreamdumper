test: autocomplete dialog disappearing as you keep typing? - should be fixed..
make jsui usable for some basic browser js analysis..(document.write, document.body.innerHTML, document.location)

jsui, if word under cursor is a recgonized function name, and user is holding ctrl, turn it blue and underline
      if they click, navigate to function (lot of work with the func list sitting right there..but with a shift
      too could be search all..handy but allot of work

jsui override right click with custom..navigate to, find all (way easier than above)

jsui click on a function to highlight in txt, select it in func list?

jsui find all column to show which function the result is in?
jsui keep track of line positions on function click and have back forward buttons

rtclick on highlighted decimal number, menu option Hex

graph ui navigate on node click (pita)

find all trigger form resize
